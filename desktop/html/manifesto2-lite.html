          				I've changed a good lot in a year. The woman I am has changed
          				drastically. Rather, I haven't changed much at all - I've finally
          				found myself, standing among the mental refuse I collected like armor.
        			</p>
        			<p>
          				I used to concern myself, primarily, with privacy-related issues. As
          				silly as it may sound, but as I've become more comfortable in my own
          				skin, as my own self, I have had to extend my interests such that I'm
          				not constantly trying to HIDE myself. Rather, I've found myself
          				burning, striving, and begging to be FOUND.
        			</p>

          				Viihna as I know her is one of the most passionate people on this
          				goddamn planet. I have tried time and time again to snuff out my own
          				light. To temper myself. To make myself take up less room. To take up
          				less space. Quite frankly FUCK THAT. More importantly, there is
          				something in me that simply refuses to die. I can't just turn off and
          				fade into the static. To become just another Person. I am Me.
        			</p>

          					To some, this may sound silly, but I challenge the reader to really
          					examine themself in the mirror. Is the you that you allow yourself to
          					be everyday, is that the You you want to be? Don't look away. Look
          					yourself right in the eye. I challenge you to meet yourself at a level
          					where you can stake your claim to yourself, that you are on your own
          					chosen path to destinations you chart. No one else defines that map.
          					No one else tells you the styles, the manners through which you can
          					express, can be, can interact, can love and live. That's up to you. I
          					challenge you to find the absolute bounds of what that means for
          					yourself. I challenge you to look as far into yourself as you can. I
          					challenge you, myself, all of the world to stare into that darkness
          					where you find fear and uncertainty - grab for more.
