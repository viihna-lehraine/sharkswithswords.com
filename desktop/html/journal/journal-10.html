            <p>Oh...hell. It's been awhile. A long time. I'm not even gonna say when the next update will be because I swear, every time I do it becomes an even longer gap between the update in question and the one following.</p>
						<p>I've grown into myself since I last wrote here. I was forced to grow. To adapt. To change. Quite honestly, my boyfriend of 20 years left me quite suddenly. I knew things weren't on the best terms when he left, but it was still a massive shock to my system. 20 years is a long time - especially when the beginnings of it stretch back into childhood. I had formed my identity around him. And it was choking the hell out of me without me ever having a chance to know it. Happiness was just never going to be part of the equation because by the very nature of our relationship, we weren't giving each other the space to grow and become our real selves.</p>
						<p>Well, as time went on, it became clear that he WAS growing and becoming his real self despite how it affected me. I never wanted to stop that growth in the first place. But feeling him grow away from me hurt BADLY. It caused a great rift that never truly healed. In retrospect, it felt like he fell out of love with me a long time ago. Without getting into explicit details, I'll say that physical intimacy had never been our collective strong suit. He just never wanted me the way I wanted him. It had slowly eroded my self-esteem. I always thought it was something to do with me, but there was no way I could have fixed the fundamental disconnect in how we relate to ourselves and the world. I just don't think there's any way you can reconcile the breaking of a love between a gay trans gray-asexual man and an INTENSELY physical transfem lesbian. There's a long story about how we even got there, but I think I've said all that need be said about that for now.</p>
						<p>I've begun living. For real. I don't hide away staring at code for 14 hours at a time. Fuck, I've finally been writing and producing my own album. I've been writing poetry. I've been going out to just write in public, meeting people. I'm honestly happy to finally have what I call my Divine Slut phase. I practice magic again. I begin each day with a prayer to the universe expressing gratitude and wishes for blessings upon myself and my loved ones.</p>
						<p>I've become a woman with GRAVITY. I've stopped apologizing for taking up all the space that I need to in order to stretch my wings and be myself. My charisma bends reality now because I am finally self-possessed. People can feel the difference when I walk into a room, and my life force is like the sun. It cannot be hidden, even though I spent most of my damn life trying to hide.</p>
						<p>I would also like to thank hormonal transition for giving me the emotional clarity and finally, an earned confidence in myself. It isnt the kind that can be shaken by an event or a person any longer, because I finally know who I am. And Viihna is a part of who I am, sure. But in the spirit of things, I've stopped hiding behind it as well. It's nice to meet you world - my name is Melody. I'm here to live fully, completely, and honestly. I alchemize pain into fire. I use tht fire to burn new pathways for myself and others into the truth of now.</p>
						<p>And the greatest part? I am grateful every day to live here and now. No longer stuck in the past. Or begging for a future I can stomach. I am HERE. Today. Now. I am fully present in this moment and it is an ADDICTIVE feeling.</p>
            <br>
