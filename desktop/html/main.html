                    <p>I don't even know where to begiiiiiiin. SO.MUCH.HAS.CHANGED! Let me get started...</p>
										<p>First, I'm happy to say I'm now a card-carrying, egg-cracked, trans girl. I've finally come to accept and embrace it. I've come out. I present out in the world and I'm not afraid anymore! When people give me shit and call me ignorant shit, I don't shy away. I assert who I am with confidence! I'm so proud to be who I am and I'm comfortable and happy to be in my own skin. It's AMAZING!!! I never even realized just how much I was repressing in myself. I feel like I'm finally learning how to just breathe and be myself. I'm MEETING myself for the first time. But yeah I'll spare you more of my ramblings. I'll be writing up a full journal post about this experience soon. Check it out! 🦈 😎 ✨</p>
										<p>On a more mundane but still exciting note...I have poured so much of my heart and soul into learning programming. I spent a few months strictly in HTML/CSS/JavaScript trying to absorb the basics. I started picking up TypeScript after I realized that, well, the loose typing of JavaScript was fucking me up. Don't get me wrong, TypeScript took a LONG time to get any degree of familiarty with. I feel like I'm coming into my own, though (with a LOT of effort!)</p>
										<p>I worked on ColorGen (my custom color palette generator) for awhile until I got the idea to try and create a new and improved personal guestbook website! I don't wanna share too many details yet because I'm still in the build stage, but it's been a blast. This also led me into learning NodeJS for backend development. MOTHERFUCKIN' BRAIN BLAST BABY! I spent about half of my hiatus beating my brain into mush learning backend development.</p>
										<p>I've started up several other projects too, just to give myself a change of pace. Like. A lot of TypeScript projects, mostly web apps. I also started learning to use Tailwind CSS and Sass. Made a short effort to learn ReactJS (yeeeeah I'll try that again later lmaaaaaooooo).</p>
										<p>In the last month or so I decided I might as well translate my TS/JS knowledge to Python and get it into my skull. And yeah I decided to take a dive into a simple C++ project. After many nights of screaming at an absent god that allowed such would allow such a clusterfuck to exist, I finally started learning a few basics. Man, it's hard as FUCK at my level of experience but I'm HERE FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S SO FUCKING FUN AND POWERFUL!</p>
										<p>Aight cheesebags, Ima let y'all go for now. Thanks for tuning in!!! 🦈 🏳️‍⚧️ ♀️ 💙</p>

                    <p>Well, on one hand I really need to go through my site here and do some basic maintenance. And add more to it like I keep saying I will. I keep getting distracted by coding projects. I can't believe I only started working with web app development less than 3 months ago. I'm making damn fine progress. I've been learning Node.js and a little C++ too.</p>
                    <p>For real, I can't make promises because I'm incredibly distractible and I have a lot of coding projects on my plate and many goals I'm working towards in that area of my life, but I really really really mean it when I say I want to come back and spend more time here. It's cathartic, and feels like my personal art project. So it's a matter of time.</p>
                    <p>Don't have much else to say with today's update, but it would make me really happy if you took a moment to view my project. If it's your kind of thing, you're also more than welcome to swing by my <a href="https://github.com/viihna-lehraine">Github</a> and take a look. My local server development project is set to private, but a lot of my other recent work is set to public. Anyway, see you guys again soon!</p>

                    <p>Ended up getting sucked back into working on my VPS for a bit. Then I ended up breaking the entrie VPS and having to start it all over again for the 4th time. Finally broke down and started paying for backup services. Then yesterday I was fully convinced I had broken my motherboard. It's been a rough week. Oh, well. Crisis averted and I've posted a few more mobile pages. Only 5 more to go, and I'll put up at least 2 more tomorrow. Maybe then I can finally work on some new content again!

                    <p>Welcome to my page! I love the community at Neocities, so I decided to join. Math and science have always interested me, but I never took the plunge into computer science. Lately, I've been teaching myself Python, HTML, and CSS. Accordingly, updates to this site very well may not work correctly or at all. If you have any feedback, please feel free to reach out to me (my contact info is on the bottom of the page).</p>
                    <p>I'm also a bassist and (new) singer, and plan to put my first album together in the next 12 months. I'll be sharing updates as they happen, along with links to demos and finished pieces as they become available.</p>
                    <p>I also have a deep interest in tools that help users maintain their privacy, anonymity, and security. I'll be talking about that a lot in future updates and will have a whole branch of my site dedicated to these topics. I'd like to get into the cybersecurity field one day, but for now I'm just learning the basics. Keep that in mind when I talk about that stuff later on.</p>
